# JouleThief1

Basic Joule Thief PCB
Input VCC on the Left via i/p header
Output on the right via o/p header.

I've added pads so that through hole or Surface mount
components may be used.

Base resistor may have a cap in parallel.
I haven't specified component values as people
like to tinker with values.

I've also seen curcuits where people have used surface mount inductors.
So i've added pads for two SM inductors reasonably close together.
I've swapped the connectors to the base and collector inductors.
This is experimental, it may work, or require the inductors to be closer or in 
some other configuration.

In any event, if it does not work, there are through hole pads there to accomodate a 
traditional bifiliar wound toroid.

Joule Thief experimentors should be familiar with the layout,
I may make modifications to the circuit as time goes by.

I'll update this document with any mods.
I've included the Gerber File, and a PDF image file.
